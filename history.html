        <h1>The History of Ice Cream</h1>
        <p>Ice cream-like treats have dated as far back as 550 BC, in ancient Persia. The Persians would use ice houses and ice pools to create these treats.
            There were more variants created over the years, such as a Japanese treat called kakigori. The production of ice cream became easier with the discovery of
            the endothermic effect. Prior to its finding, cream could be chilled easily but not frozen. 
            <br> In North America, ice cream was referenced in 1744 - as quoted,
            "Among the rarities [...] was some fine ice cream, which, with the strawberries and milk, eat most deliciously." It is unknown who brought the dessert to North
            America, however, confectioners sold the treat at their shops in New York and other cities during the colonial era.
            <br> Three presidents, Benjamin Franklin, Thomas
            Jefferson, and George Washington were known to have eaten and served ice cream; Jefferson helped to introduce the vanilla variant. 
            <br> Ice cream became more popular
            in the 20th century, with the introduction of the ice cream soda and later throughout the world as refrigeration became cheap. Soft ice cream was invented during
            the 20th century, and was less costly to produce.
            <br> Today, ice cream remains a popular treat, mostly being eaten by many during the summer.
